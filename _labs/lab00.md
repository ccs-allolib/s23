## Introduction

# Part 1: Get setup with the tools for this course

## Step 1: Add yourself to the GitHub organization

## Step 2: Check that you are in the GitHub Org and have a `lab00-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` repo.

In order to continue with the lab, you need to be a member of the GitHub organization, and you need to have a lab00 repo.

* Bring up the web page: <https://github.com> and login to your GitHub account.
* Then, in the same browser window, navigate to <https://github.com/allolib-s23>.   Then go to the tab that says `People`, and under that tab, search for your own name (or GitHub id).  You should be able to see the members of the organization, and your name should appear in that list.
  * If you are not able to see the `People` tab, or your name does not appear in the list, look at the top of the page for <https://github.com/allolib-s23> and see if you find an invitation to the organization that you haven't accepted yet.  If that appears, please click to accept the invitation to the organization.  After doing this, one of the staff will need to create your lab02 repository, so ask for assistance.
* Assuming you got this far, look under the tab for repositories.  You should see a listing for a repository called `lab00-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` where `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` is your GitHub username (for example `lab00-cgaucho`).
  * If you don't see a `lab00-YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` repo, then ask a staff member for assistance.


## Step 6: Set up git and ssh keys for your machine

There are two pieces of "one time setup" that you need to do in order
to configure your machine to work with git/github:

* <https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/git_csil_configuration>
* <https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_ssh_keys>

You should only need to do this once (not even once per course, but once for all time for your CSIL account.)
