# Final for Intro to Allolib Course, Spring 2023

For the final presentations: the final exam slot is Wednesday, June 14, 2023 8:00 AM - 11:00 AM, but let's gather at 9:00; I expect
we'll need until 11am.  Please plan a presentation that fits in a 5 minutes time slot; it's ok if you don't need the entire time.

You may show a single piece, multiple pieces, or excerpts from multiple pieces, as long as you don't exceed 5 minutes.

# Written Summary (may by public or private)

Please also prepare about a 1-page written summary of your work this quarter in your [notes repo]().
* If you are ok with this being public, you may leave your notes repo public, 
  in which case the contents will linked to from [here](https://allolib-s23.github.io/).
* If you prefer your summary to be private, simply change the visibility of your notes repo from public to private.  It will
  still be visible to your classmates and to the instructor, but not to the public.

Please include for each piece:
* Title (or you can say "Untitled" if it is an original with no title.
* Whether it is original or a transcript/arrangement.
* If transcription/arrangement, please credit original composers and/or performers as appropriate.
* Link to repo, and instructions for playing (or it is includes a live performance element, suggestions to the performer)
* Brief description of what you were exploring in the piece.  Examples of what you might have been exploring (non-exclusive):
  - A particular synthesis technique (additive, subtractive, FM, Karplus-Strong plucked string)
  - Trying to emulate a particular instrument(s) sound
  - A particular musical style or form
  - A particular kind of graphics
  - A way of extending or exploring the capabilities of allolib, a particular way of organizing the code
  - A way of acheiving some kind of musical expresssion


# Final Self Assessment

Please also send me an email with subject line "Allolib S23 Summary" where you link to your written assessment above, and then
suggest a final course grade (those enrolled in CCS version, I'd like you to do this anyway as an exercise, even though your final grade will be 
4 units of "pass").

I think everyone in the class has earned at least a B, so the choices are A, A-, B+ or B.   

Please choose which of these you feel is appropriate, and justify
it based on evidence of learning, and the level of effort you put into the course.  This justification does not need to be
long (a few sentences is enough; at most a paragraph).  

Also: in making the determination as to what grade is appropriate, and writing your justification, rather than comparing your work with that of others, please look primarily at your own learning: 
* Compare your own capabilities at the beginning of the course vs. your own capabilities at the end of the course.
* Compare the level of effort you put into this course with the level of effort you put into other upper division CS courses.
